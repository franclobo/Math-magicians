# Math-magicians

This is the first project of the Math Magicians application. I will set up the environment and tools needed to develop a React application.

## Built With

- Visual Studio Code and GitHub.
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Linters for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Redux.
- WebPack and Gitflow.

## Getting Started

"Math magicians" is a website for all fans of mathematics. It is a Single Page App (SPA) that allows users to:

- Make simple calculations.
- Read a random math-related quote.

By building this application, I will learn how to use React.
